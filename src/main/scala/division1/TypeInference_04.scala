  * exact meaning of inference is "guess", so here the term type inference refers to guessing the
  * type of the data of a variable when its type is not defined explicitly.
  *
  * val <Name of our variable> : <Scala type> = <Some literal>
  * so even if the scala type is not defined , scala is smart enough to guess the data type.
